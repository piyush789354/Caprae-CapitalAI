SmartProspect AI - AI-Readiness Challenge Report
Project Overview
SmartProspect AI is a lean and high-impact lead qualification tool built specifically for B2B SaaS and M&A prospecting. Developed in under 5 hours for the AI-Readiness Challenge, the script streamlines the process of discovering and scoring qualified leads by focusing on verified domain-level data and decision-maker relevance. It builds on concepts seen in tools like getcohesiveai.com’s scraper but emphasizes simplicity, portability, and accuracy.

Core Capabilities
Role-Based Lead Scoring
Prioritizes contacts by evaluating email addresses for executive-level roles like CEO, Founder, and CTO, helping surface the most valuable leads first.
Reliable Website Resolution & Scraping
Uses DuckDuckGo to find official company domains. With updated logic for decoding URLs properly, the script eliminates access errors tied to malformed links.
Email Harvesting & Clean Output
Leverages regex to identify and deduplicate contact emails, ensuring only valid, unique data is retained.
Export-Ready Results
Saves leads in a structured CSV format that’s ready for integration with CRMs or sales pipelines.

Why It Delivers Results
Strategic Scoring Logic: Focuses attention on leads most likely to have purchasing authority.
Minimal Overhead: Operates without browser automation or paid APIs—lightweight and fast by design.
Ethical Data Usage: Scrapes only publicly available information, maintaining compliance with good data practices.

Tech Stack
